So we are using Gemini API key to mimic the API information. (If someone finds a free OpenAI key plz change the code in the server.js)

When cloned in your local, make sure you install the modules, create a .env file
with PORT of your choice and a variable named GEMINI_API_URL. 
Make sure you name it like this else the code does not work. **  GEMINI_API_URL **
